Hearthstone Card Analysis

This is a small data-science project to demonstrate my abilities with common tools and processes. The aims of this project are to:
<ol>
    <li> Create a dataframe that includes all Hearthstone Cardss and a value that we can associate with their strength</li>
    <li> Use https://rapidapi.com/omgvamp/api/hearthstone/ to get the full information for each card </li>
    <li> Create and normalize dataframe that includes baisic features that could be relevant to a card's strength </li>
    <li> Use TensorFlow to create a neural network that can predict the strength of hypothetical cards </li>
</ol>
This project is unlikely to yield impactful results, since the strength of cards is tied to complex factors like card-specific text that will not be evaluated in this project. The goal of this project is to show my competence with data science tools. 

This project was NOT built from any template. This work is completely self motivated and directed.

Please view the Jupyter Notebook to see my process and results. Errors were included in this notebook to show my process and ability to problem-solve.
