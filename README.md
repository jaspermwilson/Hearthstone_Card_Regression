Hearthstone Card Analysis

This is a small data-science project to demonstrate my abilities with common tools and processes. The aims of this project are to:
<ol>
    <li> Create a dataframe that includes all Hearthstone Cardss and a value that we can associate with their strength</li>
    <li> Use https://rapidapi.com/omgvamp/api/hearthstone/ to get the full information from each card </li>
    <li> Create and normalize dataframe that includes baisic features that could be relevant to a card's strength </li>
    <li> Use ML tools to make a function that can predict the strength of hypothetical cards </li>
</ol>
This project is unlikely to weild impactful results, since the strength of cards is tied to complex factors like card-specific text that will not be evaluated in this project. The goal of this project is to show my proficiency with data science tools. Hypothetically, a text-analysis may be able to improve my results but the sample size is likely not large enough for this approach to be effective
